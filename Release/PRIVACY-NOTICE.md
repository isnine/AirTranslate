# AirTranslate Privacy Notice Draft

AirTranslate transcribes and translates audio playing on the user's Mac.

AirTranslate is an independent open-source project and is not affiliated with Apple or OpenAI.

## Data Handling

- AirTranslate does not require an account.
- AirTranslate does not include a developer-operated backend.
- AirTranslate does not include analytics, ads, tracking SDKs, or telemetry SDKs.
- Captured audio is used for live transcription and translation while the user has capture running.
- Saved transcripts are stored locally in the app's macOS container.
- Settings are stored locally with macOS app preferences.

## Apple System Services

AirTranslate uses Apple system frameworks, including ScreenCaptureKit, Speech, and Translation.

Speech recognition and language assets may be processed or downloaded through Apple-managed system services. AirTranslate does not send audio, transcripts, or translations to a server operated by this app's developer.

## Optional OpenAI GPT Mode

GPT mode is optional and works only after the user provides an OpenAI API key.

When GPT mode or an OpenAI translation model is enabled, AirTranslate sends the necessary audio or text to OpenAI's API to produce realtime transcription, translation, or translated audio output.

OpenAI API keys are user-provided runtime data. AirTranslate stores them in macOS Keychain and does not include API keys in the source tree, release scripts, or generated release bundles.

## Permissions

AirTranslate requests only permissions tied to its core function:

- Screen Recording, because ScreenCaptureKit requires it for system audio capture.
- System Audio Recording, because the app captures audio playing on the Mac.
- Speech Recognition, because the app converts captured audio into text.

AirTranslate does not request Contacts, Calendar, Photos, Location, browser data, or Full Disk Access.
